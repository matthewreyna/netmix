NetMix
=======================

NetMix is an algorithm for identifying altered subnetworks with node scores that are distributed differently from other nodes in the network.  NetMix improves upon current methods by actively estimating the size of an altered subnetworks using the observed distribution of scores on the network.  *This README is under construction.*
